                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups Almond Flour</li>
                    <li>3 Tablespoon whey protein powder (optional but makes the texture of the bread more soft.)</li>
                    <li>1/2 Cup coconut oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 Coconut canned milk</li>
                    <li>3 Eggs</li>
                    <li>2 Teaspoon baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 Teaspoon BAKING SODA</li>
                    <li>1 Tablesppon Italian Seasoning</li>
                    <li>1/4 Teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Preheat oven to 300 F, mix all the ingredients and pour batter into the bread pan. Put pan inside the oven and bake it for 45 minutes to 0ne hour.Then, healthy and grainless bread is ready for breakfast. This bread can be used as any other bread,it can be toasted, it can be used for sandwhich.<br> As authors claim, I tried baking this bread with both adding and not adding whey powder. whey powder does help to make the texture of the bread more soft and fluffy.</p>
