                         title="Raw Vegan Cheese Cake."/><br>
                    This is another easy,dairyfree,healthy cheescake. It is made from nuts and strawberries or blueberries. The best thing about this cake is that it does not need to be baked.Once i tried making it for one of my friend baby shower and it was pretty hit. Nobody could beleive that it was dairy free and made from all nuts and fruits.<br>
                    I made this cake using and modifying receipe from <a target="_blank" href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRz5qFVQQ4w">The Cooking Foodie</a><br>
                    Chop 1 and half cup of dried Alomnds, walnuts or Pecans with some pitted dates in the food processor.Add dates depending on your preference of sweetness. Mix it untill it looks like crust. Transfer the crushed nuts in the springform cake pan and press it hard with your hands or with cup.Soak two cups of cashews for couple of hours or boil them if needed quickly. Drain it and blend it in the food procesor adding some pitted dates(Dates are optional if you would like to add more sweetness).Add some blueberries or strawberries dependning on the taste or color you prefer. Than add this mixture of cashews and strawberries or blueberries mixture on top of the crushed nuts.Than freeze it overnight.<br>Since this are not baked, it has to be inside freeze for at least 4,5 hours.Once they are out from the freeze than Vegan cheese cake is ready to serve.
